# LSTM-with-multi-dimensional-input-and-output
This project is created for LSTM with multi-dimension input and output. In this project, it just gives a simple example, so the effect would not be guaranteed.

In ``main.py``, it gives an example which use the data of flights. And input have two dimensions by splicing two 1D inputs, the output is the same. You can use your own data to run this project, and adjust the parameters if needed.
### How to run this project
Configure the following python environment:
pandas、nunmpy、torch.
Run the ``main.py``
